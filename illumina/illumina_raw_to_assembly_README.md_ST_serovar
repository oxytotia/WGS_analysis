This repository contains a comprehensive Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) pipeline for processing Illumina sequencing data:

  1. Preprocessing & Quality Control
• FastQC: Quality assessment of raw reads
• MultiQC: Aggregates FastQC results into a single report

  2. Read Trimming & Filtering
• Trimmomatic: Removes low-quality reads and adapters (sliding window can be adjusted - default: 4:20)
